In this\n                            book, we’ll teach you how to <strong>develop your own apps</strong>, and we’ll start by\n                            getting you to build a basic app and run it on an Android Virtual Device. Along the way, you’ll meet\n                            some of the basic components of all Android apps, such as <strong>activities</strong> and\n                            <strong>layouts</strong>.

We’re going to\n                            show you how to build apps with multiple activities, and how you can get your apps\n                            talking to each other using intents. We’ll also look at how you can use intents to go\n                            beyond the boundaries of your app and make activities in other apps on your device\n                            perform actions.

What happens when an activity is created\n                            and destroyed? Which methods get called when an activity is made visible and appears in\n                            the foreground, and which get called when the activity loses the focus and is hidden? And\n                            how do you save and restore your activity’s state?\n                        </ChapterSummary>\n\n                        <ChapterSummary title=\"Chapter 5\" subtitle=\"Enjoy the View\" subsubtitle=\"views and view groups\" img=\"chap05img.png\">\n                            <h2>You’ve seen how to arrange GUI components using a linear layout, but so far\n                                we’ve only scratched the surface.</h2>\n\n                            In this chapter we’ll look a little deeper and show you how linear layouts really work.\n                            We’ll introduce you to the frame layout, a simple layout used to stack views, and we’ll\n                            also take a tour of the main GUI components and how you use them. By the end of the\n                            chapter, you’ll see that even though they all look a little different, all layouts and\n                            GUI components have more in common than you might think.\n                        </ChapterSummary>\n\n                        <ChapterSummary title=\"Chapter 6\" subtitle=\"Put Things in their Place\" subsubtitle=\"constraint layouts\" img=\"chap06img.png\">\n                            <h2>Let’s face it, you need to know how to create great layouts.</h2>\n\n                            If you’re building apps you want people to use, you need to make sure they look exactly\n                            the way you want.

To deal with this, we’ll introduce you to Android’s new\n                            constraint layout, a type of layout you build visually using a blueprint.
